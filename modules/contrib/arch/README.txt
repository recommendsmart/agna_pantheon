Arch
===============

Arch is an e-commerce Drupal module.

We would like to keep the list of core features of Arch as short as possible.

Arch manages Products in Product types.

Merchants can define multiple Prices to Products with defined Price categories.

Price access control managed via Roles and Permissions based on Price types.

If product has multiple prices Price negotiator selects the price for customer
based on permissions and price availability date range.

Customers can create an Order.

When stock management is enabled you can define multiple Warehouses. You can
manage which customer access which warehouses via Roles and Permissions. Stocks
automatically reduced when a customer place a new Order.
