/**
 * Inform the product access system what permissions the user has.
 *
 * This hook is for implementation by product access modules. In this hook,
 * the module grants a user different "grant IDs" within one or more
 * "realms". In hook_product_access_records(), the realms and grant IDs are
 * associated with permission to view, edit, and delete individual products.
 *
 * The realms and grant IDs can be arbitrarily defined by your product access
 * module; it is common to use role IDs as grant IDs, but that is not required.
 * Your module could instead maintain its own list of users, where each list has
 * an ID. In that case, the return value of this hook would be an array of the
 * list IDs that this user is a member of.
 *
 * A product access module may implement as many realms as necessary to properly
 * define the access privileges for the products. Note that the system makes no
 * distinction between published and unpublished products. It is the module's
 * responsibility to provide appropriate realms to limit access to unpublished
 * content.
 *
 * Product access records are stored in the {arch_product_access} table and
 * define which grants are required to access a product. There is a special case
 * for the view operation -- a record with product ID 0 corresponds to a
 * "view all" grant for the realm and grant ID of that record. If there are no
 * product access modules enabled, the core product module adds a product ID 0
 * record for realm 'all'. Product access modules can also grant "view all"
 * permission on their custom realms; for example, a module could create a
 * record in {arch_product_access} with:
 * @code
 * $record = array(
 *   'pid' => 0,
 *   'gid' => 888,
 *   'realm' => 'example_realm',
 *   'grant_view' => 1,
 *   'grant_update' => 0,
 *   'grant_delete' => 0,
 * );
 * db_insert('arch_product_access')->fields($record)->execute();
 * @endcode
 * And then in its hook_product_grants() implementation, it would need to
 * return:
 * @code
 * if ($op == 'view') {
 *   $grants['example_realm'] = array(888);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * If you decide to do this, be aware that the product_access_rebuild() function
 * will erase any product ID 0 entry when it is called, so you will need to make
 * sure to restore your {arch_product_access} record after
 * product_access_rebuild() is called.
 *
 * For a detailed example, see product_access_example.module.
 *
 * @param \Drupal\Core\Session\AccountInterface $account
 *   The account object whose grants are requested.
 * @param string $op
 *   The product operation to be performed, such as 'view', 'update', or
 *   'delete'.
 *
 * @return array
 *   An array whose keys are "realms" of grants, and whose values are arrays of
 *   the grant IDs within this realm that this user is being granted.
 *
 * @see product_access_view_all_products()

/**
 * Set permissions for a product to be written to the database.
 *
 * When a product is saved, a module implementing hook_product_access_records()
 * will be asked if it is interested in the access permissions for a product. If
 * it is interested, it must respond with an array of permissions arrays for
 * that product.
 *
 * Product access grants apply regardless of the published or unpublished status
 * of the product. Implementations must make sure not to grant access to
 * unpublished products if they don't want to change the standard access control
 * behavior. Your module may need to create a separate access realm to handle
 * access to unpublished products.
 *
 * Note that the grant values in the return value from your hook must be
 * integers and not boolean TRUE and FALSE.
 *
 * Each permissions item in the array is an array with the following elements:
 * - 'realm': The name of a realm that the module has defined in
 *   hook_product_grants().
 * - 'gid': A 'grant ID' from hook_product_grants().
 * - 'grant_view': If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member
 *   of this gid within this realm can view this product. This should usually be
 *   set to $product->isPublished(). Failure to do so may expose unpublished
 *   content to some users.
 * - 'grant_update': If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member
 *   of this gid within this realm can edit this product.
 * - 'grant_delete': If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member
 *   of this gid within this realm can delete this product.
 * - langcode: (optional) The language code of a specific translation of the
 *   product, if any. Modules may add this key to grant different access to
 *   different translations of a product, such that (e.g.) a particular group is
 *   granted access to edit the Catalan version of the product, but not the
 *   Hungarian version. If no value is provided, the langcode is set
 *   automatically from the $product parameter and the product's original
 *   language (if specified) is used as a fallback. Only specify multiple grant
 *   records with different languages for a product if the site has those
 *   languages configured.
 *
 * A "deny all" grant may be used to deny all access to a particular product or
 * product translation:
 * @code
 * $grants[] = array(
 *   'realm' => 'all',
 *   'gid' => 0,
 *   'grant_view' => 0,
 *   'grant_update' => 0,
 *   'grant_delete' => 0,
 *   'langcode' => 'ca',
 * );
 * @endcode
 * Note that another module product access module could override this by
 * granting access to one or more products, since grants are additive. To
 * enforce that access is denied in a particular case, use
 * hook_product_access_records_alter(). Also note that a deny all is not written
 * to the database; denies are implicit.
 *
 * @param \Drupal\arch_prpduct\Entity\ProductInterface $product
 *   The product that has just been saved.
 *
 * @return array|null
 *   An array of grants as defined above.
