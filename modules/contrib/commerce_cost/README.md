# Commerce Cost
Adds cost fields to order items in Drupal Commerce.

## Order Item cost
The cost of an order item is the cost of its purchasable entity at the time of
sale.

This cost is updated when an order refreshes, so it doesn't change after an
order is placed.

## Promotions
Adds a Cost Plus Percent promotion that applies an adjustment to order items to
set the price to your cost plus a percentage markup.
